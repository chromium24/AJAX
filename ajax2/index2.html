    <title>AJAX - Asynchronous Aspect</title>
    <!--NOTES:
    <h2>In this case, the only purpose of this HTML page is to call the script.js script which in turn will render an AJAX call to send/retrieve data.</h2>
    <H3>When an AJAX call is coded to run asynchronously, the page is able to load even though the server may not be done returning all of the
        data requests.</H3>
    <h4>The browsers' AJAX API maintains a property called readyState. Value range is 0 to 4. 0 indicates that the request hasn't been
        sent yet. 4 indicates that the operation of sending and receiving requests is complete. You can view the value in the console within the
        XMLHttpRequest object.</h4>
    <h4>When the readyState value reaches the value of 4, then we are now able to work with the data that has returned. This is a condition
        that can be checked for.</h4>-->
